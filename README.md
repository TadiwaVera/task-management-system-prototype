# task-management-system-prototype
This prototype system uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend and Spring Boot with JPA/Hibernate on the backend. It provides full CRUD task management: users can create, view, update, and delete tasks via REST API calls, with data persisted through a simple JPA-configured relational database.
